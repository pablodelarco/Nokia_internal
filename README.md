# Automated Excel NetActâ„¢ Data Processing and Reporting using Python

This Python code automatically process the reports from Excel and create new worksheets with the data we need.
The code receives as input the original Excel report from NetAct, and generates as output a new Excel document with the desired data.

## Functionalities

- Input Time Ranges: The code asks the user to provide time ranges, like "3:30, 3:45", in a specific format.

- Data Processing: The code reads data from two Excel files that contain information about network performance.
It processes and organizes the data for specific metrics (KPIs) related to network performance.

- Combining Data: The code combines the processed data from the Excel files into a single output file.
It creates a new Excel file with organized tables for each metric.

- Generating Output: The code generates a new Excel file named "combined_tables.xlsx" with the organized and formatted data.
Each table corresponds to a different metric and is easy to explore.
